## 📂 Usage  

1. **Prepare Data**:  
   - Obtain a high-resolution image of the Moon.  
   - Use a dataset containing optical reflection profiles of lunar minerals.  

2. **Run the Tool**:  
   ```bash  
   python model.py --input data/image_name.HDR --output results 
   ```  

3. **Output**:  
   - A visual map highlighting areas of different minerals.
